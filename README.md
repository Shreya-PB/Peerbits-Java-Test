**** Note : We have not used any framework, you can follow the below information to test the programs ****


**Problem statement 1 :-**

**Write a program to reverse the integer, you cannot convert integer to string and cannot use int.parse function.**



To Run the program please follow the below steps.

1. Download ReverseNumber.java from https://github.com/Shreya-PB/Peerbits-Java-Test/blob/shreya/src/com/example/ReverseNumber.java

2. Open command prompt from the saved location of ReverseNumber.java file and run command "javac ReverseNumber.java" to compile the file

3. Now run command "java ReverseNumber" to execute the program








**Problem statement 2 :-**

**Write a program to multiply two strings and produce a result as a string.
E.g. String A = 25 and string B = 125 , result = 3125. Donâ€™t use string.parseInt or Integer.valueof functions.**



To Run the program please follow the below steps.

1. Download ReverseNumber.java from https://github.com/Shreya-PB/Peerbits-Java-Test/blob/shreya/src/com/example/MultiplyTwoStringNumbers.java

2. Open command prompt from the saved location of MultiplyTwoStringNumbers.java file and run command "javac MultiplyTwoStringNumbers.java" to compile the file

3. Now run command "java MultiplyTwoStringNumbers" to execute the program
